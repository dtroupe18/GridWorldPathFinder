# GridWorldPathFinder
**A* pathfinding in a gridworld maze where only straight line moves are allowed.**

The green square is where the agent would start inside the maze. The red square represents the goal state for the agent.
Blue squares are the explored cells, orange cells are the shortest path, and white cells are unexplored.

**Sample solution using A* with lower G tie-breaking**
